C# class with different algorithms for calculating the Mean Abosulute Value (MAV) that serves as a Feature Extraction technique in a Biomedical Signal.

Check the performance differences between all the algorithms

This work will serve as a paper for the VI SEB (Symposium on Biomedical Engineering).
